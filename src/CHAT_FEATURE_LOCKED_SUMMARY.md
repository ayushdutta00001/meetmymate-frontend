## Technical Implementation Details

- **Icons**: Lock icon overlay on chat features
- **Animations**: Smooth Motion/React transitions maintained

### No Breaking Changes:

## Ready for Backend Integration

### Chat System Architecture (For Future):

```typescript
// Suggested API structure (not implemented yet)
POST   /api/chat/create-conversation
GET    /api/chat/conversations/:userId
GET    /api/chat/messages/:conversationId
POST   /api/chat/send-message
PUT    /api/chat/mark-read/:messageId
POST   /api/chat/enable-for-booking/:bookingId
```

### Database Schema (For Reference):
```sql
-- Suggested tables for future implementation
conversations (
  id, user1_id, user2_id, booking_id, enabled, created_at
)

messages (
  id, conversation_id, sender_id, content, sent_at, read_at
)

chat_permissions (
  id, booking_id, enabled_at, disabled_at
)
```
